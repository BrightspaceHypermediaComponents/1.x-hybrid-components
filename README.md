# 1.x-hybrid-components

This is an interim repository for components that have not yet been upgraded to class-based Polymer 2 (or Polymer 3). Anything that lives here will only be here for a short time, and this repo in its entirety is intended to be short-lived.

Once the LMS is using Polymer 2 (or 3), this repo is no longer required, and components should be added to the respective top-level repositories of BrightspaceHypermediaComponents.
